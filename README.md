Build-Test Script and Docker Image for CS350
===
- Docker image: Minimalistic docker image with sys161 and os161 build tools, 24% smaller than other os161 images
- build-test.sh: os161 compile routines with options for looped tests and Tmux split screen GDB debugging
- Built while taking the CS350 Operating Systems course at University of Waterloo
- Not under active development as of Aug 9, 2017
- **Please ‚≠ê or fork if you found this repo helpful**

Install
---
- Login to a University of Waterloo server/terminal or install Docker on own machine
- In Terminal, navigate to parent directory of where your os161 directory will be, then run:
  ```bash
  $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrw/docker-os161/master/bootstrap.sh | bash -s
  ```
- This will create folder structure, do clean install of os161, and download the `Makefile` and `build-test.sh`
- There may be places such as in `submit.sh` that you will need to edit the file and add your username...etc

Getting Started
---
- If on your own computer within your os161 directory, start the Docker container with `make`
  - To build image from scratch, run `make build` or `make rebuild` (build without cached Docker images)
- Compile and run os161 with `./build-test.sh` and any of the options below

build-test.sh Options
---
- default: builds from source, runs side by side with GDB in Tmux
- `-b   ` - only build from source, don't run after
- `-c   ` - continuous build loop
- `-d   ` - output debug text when tests are run
- `-m   ` - run with gdb tmux panels without rebuild
- `-r   ` - run only (no gdb tmux or rebuild)
- `-t {}` - run test {test alias}
- `-l {}` - loop all following tests {#} times and log result in `logs/` directory
- `-w   ` - clear all logs
