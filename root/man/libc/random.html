<h3>Name</h3>
random - pseudorandom number generation

<h3>Library</h3>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;<br>
<br>
long<br>
random(void);<br>
<br>
void<br>
srandom(unsigned long <em>seed</em>);<br>

<h3>Description</h3>

random returns a number between 0 and 0x7fffffff (RAND_MAX). This
number is selected using a rather complex generator which is believed
to generate randomness of an acceptable (though not cryptographic)
quality. Unlike with some generators, all bits of the values returned
are random.
<p>

srandom initializes the generator state based on the passed-in
<em>seed</em>. If srandom is not called, the sequence of numbers
returned by random is the same as if srandom had been called with a
<em>seed</em> of 1.
<p>

The implementation of random and srandom used in OS/161 is software
developed by the University of California, Berkeley and its
contributors.
