<h3>Name</h3>
mksfs - create an SFS filesystem

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
/sbin/mksfs <em>raw-device</em> <em>volname</em>
<br>
host-mksfs <em>disk-image-file</em> <em>volname</em>

<h3>Description</h3>

mksfs creates a new SFS filesystem on the specified device or disk
image. The volume name is set to <em>volname</em>.
<p>

If mksfs is used under OS/161, the first form should be used, where
<em>raw-device</em> is a raw device name (such as "lhd1raw:"). Don't
use a device that's already mounted (or being used for swap).
<p>

mksfs can also be used on the System/161 host OS, in which case the
second form should be used. The host-compiled version of mksfs knows
how to deal with the header on System/161 disk images and does the
right thing.
<p>

Note that as of this writing host-mksfs cannot create disk image
files. This is a bug and will hopefully be addressed eventually.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

mksfs uses the following system calls:
<ul>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/open.html>open</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/read.html>read</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/write.html>write</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/lseek.html>lseek</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/fstat.html>fstat</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/close.html>close</A>
<li> <A HREF=../syscall/_exit.html>_exit</A>
</ul>

mksfs should function properly once the file system assignment is
complete. You will likely need to make some changes to it in the
course of doing that assignment.
