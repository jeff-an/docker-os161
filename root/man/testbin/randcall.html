<h3>Name</h3>
randcall - make randomized system calls

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
/testbin/randcall [-f] [-c <em>count</em>] [-r <em>seed</em>] <em>callset</em>

<h3>Description</h3>

randcall makes randomized system calls, that is, system calls with
completely random arguments. The <em>callset</em> determines which
list of system calls it uses; it is either "all", which does
everything, or a number that identifies one of the assignments, in
which case it exercises all the system calls that are supposed to be
working when that assignment is complete. (If the lists compiled into
randcall are wrong, contact your course staff.)
<p>

Ordinarily, in case some of these calls cause process termination,
randcall forks before making each call. This can be slow, so the -f
option can be used to suppress this behavior.
<p>

The -c <em>count</em> option tells randcall to make <em>count</em>
iterations through the list of calls it's using. (It always goes
through the list sequentially.) The default count is 100.
<p>

The -r <em>seed</em> option allows one to set the pseudorandom seed
used by randcall to generate the call arguments. The default seed is
0.
<p>

randcall prints what it's doing, so if it blows up you should be able
to see what happened.
<p>

The system calls that do not take arguments are not on any of the call
lists. Neither is <A HREF=../syscall/reboot.html>reboot</A>, to prevent
accidental system shutdown.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

randcall should never under any circumstances crash the kernel, no
matter what call list is in use.

<h3>Bugs</h3>

There should be an option to seed the random generator from 
<A HREF=../dev/random.html>random:</A>.
