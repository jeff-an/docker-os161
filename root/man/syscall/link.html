<h4 align=center>OS/161 Reference Manual</h4>

<h3>Name</h3>
link - create hard link to a file

<h3>Library</h3>
Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;<br>
<br>
int<br>
link(const char *<em>oldname</em>, const char *<em>newname</em>);

<h3>Description</h3>

link creates a new name, <em>newname</em>, for the file referred to by
<em>oldname</em>. Henceforth, both names are equally valid ways to
refer to the same file. The file is only deleted when all names are
removed. This is a "hard link".
<p>

The creation of the new name is atomic. The two names must be on the
same filesystem. Directories may not be hard-linked.
<p>

<h3>Return Values</h3>
On success, link returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and
<A HREF=errno.html>errno</A> is set according to the error
encountered.

<h3>Errors</h3>

The following error codes should be returned under the conditions
given. Other error codes may be returned for other errors not
mentioned here.
